Naming protocol for Experimental Mussel Patch Quadrat Pictures


There are 2 ypes of pictures:

1.  Overview picture of the patch. (Differentiated by A-G, AB-AG, BA-BF).
	Note: Patches are labelled by the bolt and washer placed at the top left corner of each quadrat.
		Filename: Year-Month-Day_Site_Patch.jpg
		Example: 2013-06-26_YB-A.jpg
	When multiple overview pictures have been taken, chose the “best” one. (Do not use lowercase  letter to differentiate as before.)



2.  Detailed quadrat pictures. (Differentiated by q1-q9).
		Filename: Year-Month-Day_Site_Patch#qQuadrat.jpg
		Example: 2013-06-26_YB-Aq1.jpg;
	When multiple pictures have been taken, chose the “best” one. (Do not use lowercase  letter to differentiate as before.)

Special Note: When labeling the Cropped Photos, put a “_c” at the end of the name right before the ‘.jpg’.  This step can be automated on a Mac using the “ExpPatch_BatchImageCrop.app” AppleScript.
